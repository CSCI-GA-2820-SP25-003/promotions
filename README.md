## Overview

The Promotions Service is designed to manage promotional campaigns within a microservices architecture. It provides a RESTful API to create, update, retrieve, and delete promotions for an e-commerce platform.

The Promotions Squad handles deals on products (Eg: 20 % discount, buy 1 get 1 etc.)

## Features Implemented

- Create new promotions

- Retrieve existing promotions

- Update promotion details

- Delete promotions

- Service health check endpoint

- Unit tests for models and routes
